## 1. üöÄ Project Overview

**ZauriScore‚Ñ¢** is an AI-powered security analysis platform for Ethereum smart contracts.  
It combines **static analysis, heuristic rules, and ML/AI insights** to deliver:

- **Trustable risk scores**  
- **Audit-ready provenance**  
- **Clear remediation steps**  
- **Fast, actionable decision-making**

**Core Motive:**  
Enable developers, auditors, and founders to make **deployment-safe decisions** with explainable, reproducible, and shareable reports under time pressure.

---

## 2. üí° Unique Selling Proposition (USP) & Features

**USP:**  
Deliver **trustable, audit-ready risk decisions** with **provenance, explainability, and repeatable outcomes**, not just raw analysis.

**Key Features:**  
- Multi-layered security analysis: **Slither, heuristics, ML risk scoring**  
- AI-powered insights using **CodeBERT** and vulnerability pattern learning  
- Proxy resolution & implementation verification  
- Comprehensive reporting: JSON, Markdown, and PDF  
- Provenance metadata: solc version, Slither version, Etherscan source, response hash  
- Go/No-Go decision summaries with top reasons  
- Exportable, shareable, and versioned reports  
- Optional ML augmentation with confidence thresholds  

---

## 3. üìÇ Use Cases

1. **Security Engineer:** Quickly decide if a contract is **deployment-safe** with explainable evidence.  
2. **Auditor:** Reproduce findings, verify environment (solc, detector versions), and export audit-ready artifacts.  
3. **PM / Founder:** Compare contract risk against baseline and share progress with stakeholders.  
4. **DevOps / Security Team:** Track contract risks over time and integrate into CI/CD workflows.  
5. **Enterprise Compliance:** Generate reports aligned with SOC2/ISO or internal policy enforcement.
